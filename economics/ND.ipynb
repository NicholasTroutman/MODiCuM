The JC can trick the mediator by providing a job with a non-deterministic output. The output is in one of two answer classes, $a1$ or $a2$ with $P(a1)>>P(a2)$.

If RP responds with $a2$ JC will request mediation, expecting the mediator to find the answer to be $a1$ and determine that the $RP$ must have cheated. \n",

This means that JC wants to maximize the chance that the Mediator will get the same answer reapeatedly which is not benefited by having additional answer classes.  \n",
